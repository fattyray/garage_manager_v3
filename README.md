# garage_manager_v3
#### the project won third prize in the engineering project show in UESTC 2023.
this project is  the final homework of the smart garage managerment system course in UESTC(a beginner course for freshmen to learn some basic skills about python ,cv,database as well as using network apis)
Great thanks to Prof.Dai bo who teaches this fine class！！！
#### how to use it
1. first you need to install all the packages neeeded
2. second,you should switch the api secret-key as well as the database secret-key to your own
3. third,use the func in the script about db to create the Tables
4. good luck,it may be able to run successfully.(There may be small bugs,and you should adjust the place from which you use to detect the car_plate if it is not successful
5. Finally,don't try to cheat,learn from the code rather than just copying it.
